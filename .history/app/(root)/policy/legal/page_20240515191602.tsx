            point.game is a platform that helps connect recreational sports
            players. Our mission is to put you - the players - first, and these
            terms attempt to do that. We know that most people skim through
            terms of use because they're boring, but we have done everything we
            can to make this easy to get through. Above every section, we'll
            summarize the most important parts, but these summaries are not
            legally binding, so please look at the full version of the text for
            a complete understanding of these terms.
