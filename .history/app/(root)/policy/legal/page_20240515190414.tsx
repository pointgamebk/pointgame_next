            point.game is a platform that helps connect recreational sports
            players. Our mission is to put you - the players - first, and these
            terms attempt to do that. We know that most people skim through
            terms of use because they're boring, but we have done everything we
            can to make this easy to get through. Above every section, we'll
            summarize the most important parts, but these summaries are not
            legally binding, so please look at the full version of the text for

          <h3 className="h3-bold text-white">Being an Organizer</h3>

          <p className="text-white italic">
            To summarize: An organizer is someone who creates a recreational
            game, or creates and administers a recreational league.
          </p>

          <h5 className="h5-bold text-white">organizer Page</h5>
          <p className="text-white">
            To become an organizer, simply launch your page to start offering
            your services. When you join point.game, you become part of the
            point.game community. You can use our tools that we provide to,
            among other things, showcase your services and engage with the
            point.game community. On point.game, you can provide your trainees
            something unique that gives them special training and skills,
            including additional access and engaging community experiences. In
            turn, you will receive loyal support from your trainees, and revenue
            from offerings that trainees have purchased on point.game.
          </p>

          <h5 className="h5-bold text-white">Payments</h5>
          <p className="text-white">
            As an organizer, you may make offerings available on point.game on a
            one-time basis. Where supported and subject to your controls as
            applicable, we may automatically increase the prices of offerings to
            patrons to account for the fees imposed by the platforms (like the
            App Store) on which the associated purchases were made in a manner
            that may be determined at our sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            We typically handle payments issues such as fraud, chargebacks, and
            resolution of payments disputes, though, for purchases made through
            certain platforms (like the App Store), the associated platforms may
            handle these payments issues. We try to provide timely access to the
            funds you've earned on point.game, usually within 48 hours after the
            camp or event has ended. Purchases made on certain platforms (like
            the App Store) and different levels and types of point.game service
            may have different timelines associated with funds becoming
            accessible to you and/or may require that reserves of funds are
            withheld from becoming accessible to you. You may, however,
            occasionally experience further delays in accessing these funds.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            We may also block or withhold access to these funds for violations
            of our terms or policies or for compliance reasons, including
            collecting tax reporting information. When this happens, we try to
            communicate the reason to you promptly. If you have questions about
            access to funds being blocked or withheld, please reach out to us.
            In order to protect organizer, we may block patrons' payments if we
            believe them to be fraudulent. Sometimes activities like refunds to
            patrons and chargebacks from patrons can put your account balance
            into the negative and any fees you've incurred from point.game or
            the platforms (like the App Store) on which the purchases were made,
            as described below, may not be refunded to you when such refunds and
            chargebacks are processed. If your balance becomes negative, we
            reserve the right to recover those funds from future payments.
          </p>

          <h5 className="h5-bold text-white">Fees</h5>

          <p className="text-white">
            As an organizer, there are fees associated with your offerings on
            point.game. The general nature of these fees is summarized below.
            These fees may increase with notice to you:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-4 text-white">
            <li>
              The platform fee, which may include a flat fee and/or is
              calculated as a percentage of successfully processed payments.
              Currently, the platform fee is 5.1% of the total price of the
              purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              The payment processing fee, which is calculated as a percentage of
              successfully processed payments and a flat fee per successfully
              processed payment and relates to the cost of processing payments
              from patrons, including recurring billing, recovering declined
              payments, and fighting fraud. Currently, the payment processing
              fee is 2.9% of the total price of the offering, plus $0.30 per
              successful charge for domestic cards.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5 className="h5-bold text-white">Tax</h5>

          <p className="text-white">
            In order to satisfy our tax obligations, we collect tax
            identification information and, in certain circumstances, report
            this information and earnings to tax authorities as legally
            required. For example, if you are located in the United States or
            are a United States citizen who has earned $600 or more, point.game
            is required to issue you a Form 1099-K at year end. For purposes of
            Forms 1099-K, we treat all organizer earnings as earned for the
            sales of goods or services. You are responsible for reporting any
            income, withholding, or other earnings-based taxes which may be due
            as a result of money you've earned on point.game.
          </p>

          <h5 className="h5-bold text-white">Restrictions</h5>

          <p className="text-white">
            We don't allow camps or events that violate our terms or policies. A
            high level summary of those rules is that we don't allow:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-4 text-white">
            <li>illegal camps or events;</li>

            <li>camps or events that are misleading or deceptive;</li>
            <li>
              camps or events that use others' intellectual property, unless you
              have written permission to use it, or your use is protected as
              fair use;
            </li>

            We are constantly experimenting with product features to make
            point.game better and may add, remove, or test features with a
            subset of organizers. Access to these features is not guaranteed and
            may not be subject to your control. Instead, we may enable and

          <h3 className="h3-bold text-white">Being a Trainee or Attendee</h3>

          <p className="text-white italic">
            To summarize: A trainee or attendee is someone who makes a purchase
            on point.game, which provides exclusive training, access and
            assistance from accomplished athletes. Through a camp or event on
            point.game, trainees may receive training and directly interact with
            organizers using tools supplied by us, and, through point.game, have
            the opportunity to engage with a community of trainees and
            organizers.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white">
            To become a trainee or attendee, simply purchase or freely obtain a
            ticket on point.game. Subject to these terms and full payment of all
            applicable charges, to the extent a ticket includes access to one or
            more of an organizer's camps or events, you receive a non-exclusive,
            non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited license to
            access and attend those camps or events for your own private,
            personal, non-promotional, non-commercial use. Camps or events you
            gain access to in this manner will generally continue to be
            available to you, but may become unavailable at any time as
            described below.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white">
            If you are located in a jurisdiction in which point.game is required
            to charge and collect tax, for example VAT or sales tax, then this
            tax is added to the total charge. Except in limited circumstances,
            this tax is shown to you when purchasing a ticket. point.game remits
            all tax collected to the applicable taxing authority. As tax is
            largely dependent on your location, you agree to keep your location
            complete and up to date in order to enable accurate collection of
            taxes.

            allow for some exceptions where refunds are granted at our sole
            discretion. If you made a purchase on certain platforms (like the
            App Store), then point.game may not be able to address any
